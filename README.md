# Getting Started

Check out our [Getting started](https://deployapps.dev/docs/getting-started) documentation page to find out how to start using DeployApps.

For more details about the `DeployApps` CLI commands, run `genezio help` or `genezio [command] help`.

# Installation

To install the `DeployApps` CLI tool, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g genezio
```

# Create a new project

Visit the [DeployApps template page](https://app.genez.io/new-project) and create a new project. You can choose from a variety of templates or start from scratch.

If you want to create a new project from scratch, you can run the following command:

```bash
genezio create
```

If you already have a project you can either [import it from you GitHub repository](https://app.genez.io/import) or deploy it from your local machine using the following command:

```bash
genezio deploy
```

# Test your project using the Test Interface

You can also test your code locally by running the following command in the `server` directory.

```bash
genezio local
```

This will spawn a local server that can be used for testing.
Now, you can navigate to the [Test Interface](https://app.genez.io/test-interface/local?port=8083) and test your project locally from GUI.

</div>

Once you are happy with your project, you can deploy it in a production environment by running: `genezio deploy`.

# Examples deployed with DeployApps

You can find out more about `DeployApps` from our [examples repository](https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples).

# Official documentation

## How does DeployApps work?

`DeployApps` is using JSON RPC 2.0 to facilitate the communication between SDK and your class. Your functions are deployed in the DeployApps infrastructure. The functions are not executed on a long lasting Virtual Machine. Instead, our system uses a serverless approach. Whenever a request is received, your code is loaded and executed. This is more cost and energy efficient. However, the developer needs to take into account the following - the values of the global variables are not persistent between runs.

Type safety is ensured by the generated SDK, even if the server and the client are not written in the same language. The CLI tool analyzes the server code generates client side types equivalent to the server side types, as well as functions with equivalent signatures.
