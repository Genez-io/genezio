# Getting Started

Check out our [Getting started](https://genezio.com/docs/getting-started) documentation page to find out how to start using Genezio.

For more details about the `genezio` CLI commands, run `genezio help` or `genezio [command] help`.

# Test your project using the Test Interface

You can also test your code locally by running the following command in the `server` directory.

```bash
genezio local
```

This will spawn a local server that can be used for testing.
Now, you can navigate to the [Test Interface](https://app.genez.io/test-interface/local?port=8083) and test your project locally from GUI.

</div>

Once you are happy with your project, you can deploy it in a production environment by running: `genezio deploy`.

# Official documentation

## How does genezio work?

`genezio` is using JSON RPC 2.0 to facilitate the communication between SDK and your class. Your functions are deployed in the Genezio infrastructure. The functions are not executed on a long lasting Virtual Machine. Instead, our system uses a serverless approach. Whenever a request is received, your code is loaded and executed. This is more cost and energy efficient. However, the developer needs to take into account the following - the values of the global variables are not persistent between runs.
