# What is [genezio](https://genez.io)?

[genezio](https://genez.io/) is a platform for developers to write, deploy and use a serverless API.

You just write your backend logic in classes using your preferred programming language then call `genezio deploy`.
The code will be deployed in a scalable and production-ready infrastructure.
An SDK is generated and you can use it to remotely call the methods of your class in a very natural way.

For more details on how to use `genezio`, you can check out the official [documentation](https://genez.io/docs).

# Features

- ü™õ&nbsp; Deploy your backend in no-time on a serverless infrastructure.
- üñºÔ∏è&nbsp; Host your frontend on the genezio infrastructure.
- ü™Ñ&nbsp; A magically-generated SDK to call your server functions from the client.
- üëÄ&nbsp; A handful of examples to start from at [genezio-examples](https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples/).
- üî®&nbsp; A dedicated GitHub Action to integrate in your CI/CD at [genezio-github-action](https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-github-action).

# Getting Started

1. **Install `genezio`.** Use the command below to install genezio:

```bash
npm install genezio -g
```

2. **Login to `genezio`.** Run the following command to login into your account:

```bash
genezio login
```

3. **Clone our `Hello World` example.** Copy the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples.git
```

4. **Navigate to the project folder.** Copy the following command in your terminal to go to the "Hello World" project folder:

```bash
cd ./genezio-examples/javascript/getting-started/server/
```

5. **Deploy your code.** Use the command below to deploy the code using `genezio`:

```bash
npm i && genezio deploy
```

6. **Test the code.** Run this command to test the code:

```bash
cd ../client && npm i && npm start
```

For more details about the `genezio` CLI commands, run `genezio help` or `genezio [command] help`.

# Test your project using the Test Interface

You can also test your code locally by running the following command in the `server` directory.

```bash
genezio local
```

This will spawn a local server that can be used for testing.
Now, you can navigate to the [Test Interface](https://app.genez.io/test-interface/local?port=8083) and test your project locally from GUI.

Once you are happy with your project, you can deploy it in a production environment by running: `genezio deploy`.

# Official documentation

## How does `genezio` work?

`genezio` is using JSON RPC 2.0 to facilitate the communication between SDK and your class. Your functions are deployed in the Genezio infrastructure. The functions are not executed on a long lasting Virtual Machine. Instead, our system uses a serverless approach. Whenever a request is received, your code is loaded and executed. This is more cost and energy efficient. However, the developer needs to take into account the following - the values of the global variables are not persistent between runs.
